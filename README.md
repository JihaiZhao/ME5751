# ME5751 Final project
Include a 4-DOF robotic arm, and a 1-DOF gripper
Workspace: the robot must reach a radius of at least 320mm range and have a vertical range of motion of 200mm
The robotic arm
o There is an orientation DOF of the arm for adjusting the orientation of the gripper
o Each joint is actuated by a servo motor
The robotic gripper
o The gripper can be driven by an electric motor. 
The controller: 
o Use a programmable a single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller (Arduino board)
o Write a kinematic controller of the robotic arm and the gripper.
  The controller implement the inverse kinematics of the robotic arm
  The gripper can be designed to have two modes: open/close
