# ME5751 Final project
Include a 4-DOF robotic arm, and a 1-DOF gripper
## Workspace
* The robot must reach a radius of at least 320mm range and have a vertical range of motion of 200mm
## The robotic arm
* There is an orientation DOF of the arm for adjusting the orientation of the gripper
* Each joint is actuated by a servo motor
## The robotic gripper
* The gripper can be driven by an electric motor. 
## The controller
* Use a programmable a single-board microcontrollers and microcontroller (Arduino board)
* Write a kinematic controller of the robotic arm and the gripper.
  * The controller implement the inverse kinematics of the robotic arm
  * The gripper can be designed to have two modes: open/close
